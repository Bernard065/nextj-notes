Server Components are guaranteed to be only rendered on the server

On the otherhand, Client Component are primarily rendered on client side. However, Next.js also pre-renders them on the server to ensure a smooth user experience and improved SEO.

Next.js by default, performs static rendering, which means, it pre-renders the necessary content on the server before sending it to the client.

## Benefits of Server-side rendering

1. Efficient utilization of server resources. Data fetching happens closer to he server, hence reducing time required to retrieve data is reduced resulting to improved performance.

2. Enhance SEO

3. Faster initial page load hence better user experience.

4. Size of JavaScript file downloaded is reduced
